## Latex

You can use Latex in your code with the <Latex> tag.

() => {
    return (
        <Latex>{"We give illustrations for the processes $e^+e^-$, gluon-gluon and $\\gamma\\gamma \\to W t\\bar b$."}</Latex>
        <Latex>{"$2^3$"}</Latex>
    );
}

Please use $ as a delimiter for every math expressions inside the <Latex> tag as you see in the example.

Guidelines:
- Wrap all the content you write in the <Latex> tags with a {""}.
- Inside the {""} please do not use another " as it will close the first " and therefore lead to parsing issues.
- This is the ONLY way to represent math expressions in your code, do not use something like.

<th style={{padding: 7}}>Estimated $P(\\mathrm{Win}\\mid \\mathrm{Serve})$</th>

This will result in an error. Instead, you would write this:

<th style={{padding: 7}}>Estimated <Latex>{"$P(\\mathrm{Win}\\mid \\mathrm{Serve})$"}</Latex></th>

If you want to write Latex into the ANSWER fields (answer_a, answer_b, etc.) use $$ to delimit the latex expressions e.g. like this:
"answer_a": "We give illustrations for the processes $e^+e^-$, gluon-gluon and $\\gamma\\gamma \\to W t\\bar b$."
